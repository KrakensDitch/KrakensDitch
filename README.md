- 👋 Hi, I’m @KrakensDitch alias Peter Molnar.
- 💼 Currently unemployed. Working on my entrepreneur business and studying.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, building applications, securing my apps. (beside I have life too and I love working on classic cars and motorcycles)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, HTML, CSS, basics. Planning to learn Angular, React, Nest JS and Electron. Other languages like Python, Java and C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building websites in the first phase of my learning. Later building applications to publish, that have real value. Then I would happily cooperate in the early stages of a startup.
