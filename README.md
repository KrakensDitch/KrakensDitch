- 👋 Hi, I’m @KrakensDitch alias Peter Molnar.
- 💼 SW specialist / presales. Working on my entrepreneur business and studying.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, building applications, securing my apps. (I also love restoring classic cars and motorcycles)
- 🌱 JS, HTML, CSS, Angular, React, Nest JS, Electron, Python, Java, C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building websites in the first phase of my learning. Later building applications to publish, that have real value. Then I would happily cooperate in the early stages of a startup.
